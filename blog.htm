	       <h1>I Am <span class="input"></span></h1>
		 <p> 19 years old. A student of DfCAMCLP-IT Satellite Campus. I am the only daughter and I have three annoying brothers. My first impression on college was a
		scary thing because we are now few steps away from graduating. The responsibilites became heavier and stressful indeed. My willingness to learn became my foundation
		to survive the nerve-racking first year.I am now half way of 1st semester of 2nd year.

		<h2>My Family</h2>
		<p>My family is quite big on both father's and mother's side. I am more close with my father's side since I grew up with my grandmother, my father's mother. She is a loving
		lola to us although she is a nagger she never fail to take care of us. My mother is also a loving mom too and a very joyful person, whenever I'm with her we never miss
		a moment to laugh at.On the other hand, my three brothers always irritate me but also make me happy. I am the happiest when I'm with my family.

		<h2>My hobbies</h2>
			<img src="C:/Users/Norman/Documents/Bloggy/roar.jpg"width="200" height="240"alt=""></img>
		<p>I learned about a new hobby which is reading manga and watching anime. I recently develop this hobby during early pandemic time. I was bored and my connection outside weakened
		and interactions with other people lessen. My recent favorite character is Rimuru Tempest of That time I Got Reincarnated As A Slime. He was cool and smart and a very funny guy. I enjoyed the whole show 
		because of the humorous events and the plot. I am still waiting for the next season.
